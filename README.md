# ENG 341 Projects

This is a collection of the `c++` projects we're asked to implement. Each project is separated into it's own dedicated directory, so you only need the directory
particular to your group. If the project assigned to your group does not have it's dedicated directory, do not panic, they'll be added soonest.

Every project follow the same structure, the source codes are stored in the `src` directory while the compiled binaries are stored in the `bin` directory
